Catalyst Studios captures the essence of reaction driven gameplay. A catalyst initiates immediate change/reaction just like the split second decisions in fast paced games such as Spit and Spoons. The name reflects our focus on reflex heavy mechanics that create fun moments and most importantly competition. "Studios" feels indie friendly, suggesting a place where ideas come to life and players connect through shared experiences.

> Catalyst Studios specializes in high energy, reflex driven games that create explosive moments of fun. Unlike traditional strategy games that reward slow planning, our games demand split second decisions and quick reactions making every round unpredictable and engaging. We blend the accessibility of classic card games like UNO with the competitive intensity of speed based games like Spit, creating experiences that anyone can learn in minutes but will want to play for hours. Our games pull people away from screens and back to the table, where real connections happen.
